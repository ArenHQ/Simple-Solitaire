#Simple Solitaire
You can find screenshots for phones and tablets [here](./Pictures/screenshots)

There is a DummyGame class with a lot of comments, if you want to add a new game. I hope it's good enough for that!

I learned Android and Java by myself using e-books and browsing Stack Overflow for solutions, so please don't expect too much from my source code :D

It is a very simple game, but customizable and with some neat functions like hints. Here is my Google Play description:

Highly customizable:
There are 6 different looking card sets in this game, 12 different card backgrounds and 6 different background colours. So you have a large choice to customize your experience!

Set up difficulty:
You can set up the difficulty for Klondike, Spider and Golf in the settings!

Automatic saving:
The current game will be saved every time you pause or close the app. So you can continue your game where you left it!

High Score list:
When winning a game, your score will be saved in a list of up to 10 high scores.

Game features:
This game has a undo function to take back up to 20 card movements. A hint function shows you up to 3 possible card movements at once.

Left handed mode:
There is a option for left handed people to mirror the card positions to the left side of the screen.

No ads:
This game is completely free without ads, tracking or something else. Just have fun :)

Landscape and tablet support: 
You can switch to landscape mode, this is better for larger screens. It is also possible to lock the orientation in the settings
